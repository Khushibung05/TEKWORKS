'''
Smart Parking System:
‚Ä¢ Create classes Vehicle, ParkingSpot, and ParkingLot.
‚Ä¢ Create multiple objects (vehicles, spots, parking lot).
‚Ä¢ Demonstrate object creation, attribute initialization, and method calls.
‚Ä¢ Make sensitive attributes private (e.g., license plate, owner name, spot status).
‚Ä¢ Provide getter/setter methods to access/update them safely.
‚Ä¢ Show that direct access fails but methods work.
‚Ä¢ Vehicle is the base class.
‚Ä¢ Derived classes:
Bike (extra attribute: helmet_required)
Car (extra attribute: seats)
SUV (extra attribute: four_wheel_drive)
Truck (extra attribute: max_load_capacity)
‚Ä¢ Each child class overrides display() to print its own details.
‚Ä¢ Create a list of different vehicle objects (Bike, Car, SUV, Truck).
‚Ä¢ Iterate and call display() ‚Üí each object responds differently.
‚Ä¢ Implement a calculate_parking_fee() method:
Bike ‚Üí ‚Çπ20/hour
Car ‚Üí ‚Çπ50/hour
SUV ‚Üí ‚Çπ70/hour
Truck ‚Üí ‚Çπ100/hour
‚Ä¢ Demonstrate runtime polymorphism by calling the method on different objects.
‚Ä¢ Create an abstract class/interface Payment (using abc module).
‚Ä¢ Define an abstract method process_payment(amount).
‚Ä¢ Create child classes:
CashPayment
CardPayment
UPIPayment
‚Ä¢ Demonstrate abstraction by processing payments differently (just print ‚ÄúPaid ‚ÇπX via UPI‚Äù).
Task 1: Vehicle Classes
Implement base and derived vehicle classes with encapsulation.
Override display() and calculate_parking_fee().
Task 2: ParkingSpot Class
Implement ParkingSpot with size restrictions (S, M, L, XL).
Methods: assign_vehicle(), remove_vehicle().
Ensure vehicle type fits correct spot size (Bike ‚Üí S+, Car ‚Üí M+, SUV ‚Üí L+, Truck ‚Üí XL only).
Task 3: ParkingLot Class
Store multiple parking spots.
Methods:
add_spot() ‚Üí add new parking spots.
show_spots() ‚Üí display all spots and their status.
park_vehicle(vehicle) ‚Üí find suitable spot and park.
unpark_vehicle(vehicle) ‚Üí remove from spot and calculate fee.
Task 4: Payment (Abstraction + Polymorphism)
When un-parking a vehicle, calculate fee (based on hours).
Ask user for payment method ‚Üí process payment using appropriate child class.
Task 5: Main Program
Create a parking lot with mixed spots.
Create multiple vehicle objects.
Park/unpark vehicles.
Demonstrate encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction throughout.

Create Parking Lot and Spots
Input (program initialization):
lot = ParkingLot("CityMall Parking")
# Add spots of different sizeslot.add_spot(ParkingSpot(1, "S"))
lot.add_spot(ParkingSpot(2, "M"))
lot.add_spot(ParkingSpot(3, "M"))
lot.add_spot(ParkingSpot(4, "L"))
lot.add_spot(ParkingSpot(5, "XL"))
Output:
Parking Lot Created: CityMall Parking Total Spots Added: 5 
üü¢ Step 2: Create Vehicles
Input:
bike1 = Bike("B101", "TS01AB1234", "Rahul", True)
car1 = Car("C201", "TS05CD5678", "Priya", 5)
suv1 = SUV("S301", "TS09EF9012", "Anjali", True)
truck1 = Truck("T401", "TS11XY4455", "Ravi", 12)
Output:
Vehicles Created: Bike ‚Üí ID: B101, Plate: TS01AB1234, Owner: Rahul Car  ‚Üí ID: C201, Plate: TS05CD5678, Owner: Priya SUV  ‚Üí ID: S301, Plate: TS09EF9012, Owner: Anjali Truck‚Üí ID: T401, Plate: TS11XY4455, Owner: Ravi 
üü¢ Step 3: Park Vehicles
Input:
lot.park_vehicle(bike1)   # Should go to Spot 1 (S)lot.park_vehicle(car1)    # Should go to Spot 2 (M)lot.park_vehicle(suv1)    # Should go to Spot 4 (L)lot.park_vehicle(truck1)  # Should go to Spot 5 (XL)lot.show_spots()
Output:
Parking Status:
Spot 1 (S): Occupied ‚Üí Bike (TS01AB1234)
Spot 2 (M): Occupied ‚Üí Car (TS05CD5678)
Spot 3 (M): EmptySpot 4 (L): Occupied ‚Üí SUV (TS09EF9012)
Spot 5 (XL): Occupied ‚Üí Truck (TS11XY4455)
üü¢ Step 4: Unpark a Vehicle + Payment
Input:
lot.unpark_vehicle(car1, hours=3)   # Car stayed 3 hours 
Output:
Car (TS05CD5678) removed from Spot 2Parking Fee = ‚Çπ150 Select Payment Method: 1. Cash 2. Card 3. UPI
Enter choice: 3Paid ‚Çπ150 using UPI
üü¢ Step 5: Final Status
Input:
lot.show_spots()
Output:
Parking Status:
Spot 1 (S): Occupied ‚Üí Bike (TS01AB1234)
Spot 2 (M): EmptySpot 3 (M): EmptySpot 4 (L): Occupied ‚Üí SUV (TS09EF9012)
Spot 5 (XL): Occupied ‚Üí Truck (TS11XY4455)
